# Sponsor PyCon AU

PyCon Australia is the national conference for developers using the Python Programming Language. After two years in Sydney with over 600 attendees each year, our Adelaide based-team is organising to bring the national and international Python community together digitally for the 11th edition of PyCon AU, as PyConline AU 2020.

Now is the perfect time to help contribute to this growing, vibrant developer community.
