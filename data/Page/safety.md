# Safety and code of conduct

All attendees of PyCon Australia 2020 will be asked to agree to be bound by a code of conduct as a condition of attendance.

PyCon Australia aims to provide a fun, welcoming and professional environment so that diverse groups of people&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;regardless of age, race, gender identity or expression, background, disability, appearance, sexuality, walk of life, or religion&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;can get together to learn from and be inspired by each other about all things Python.

We are a diverse community. Sometimes this means we need to work harder to ensure weâ€™re creating an environment of trust and respect where all who come to participate feel comfortable and included.

Details about the code of conduct will be published on this page before ticket sales and the call for proposals commences, and contact details for the safety team will be published here prior to the start of the event.

In the meantime, you can review the [PyCon AU 2019 code of conduct](https://2019.pycon-au.org/conduct/) on last year's website.
