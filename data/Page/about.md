# About the conference

PyCon AU 2020 will be held in Adelaide, Australia, in the Adelaide Convention Centre.

- August 7: Specialist Tracks
- August 8&thinsp;&ndash;&thinsp;9: Conference Main Track
- August 10&thinsp;&ndash;&thinsp;11: Development Sprints

## Specialist Tracks

The first day of PyCon AU is dedicated to specialist tracks. These tracks, also known as ‘miniconfs’, are curated by smaller specialist groups within Python community, and allow for more in-depth talks on the subject.

## Conference Main Track

The weekend of PyCon AU is the main conference event. We invite speakers from all backgrounds and levels of knowledge to share their experience and knowledge with our audience.

## Development Sprints

Following three days of talks, we hold space in our venue for two days of Development Sprints (sometimes shortened just to ‘Sprints’)

Since you’ve travelled all the way to Adelaide for a Python event, why not stay an extra day or two and stretch your legs in the new things you’ve learnt, or dive into some interesting projects you’ve heard about over the weekend?

Development Sprints provide an unstructured location for projects and contributors to work in real time on their projects, or for people to hack about with various things with people with experts in their fields.

The conference will provide copious amounts of table space, power, and internet connectivity.
