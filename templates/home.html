<h1>PyConline AU, 4&ndash;6 September 2020!</h1>
<p>
    We’re excited to officially announce the dates for PyConline AU 2020, which will be held as a virtual event on September 4-6 2020!
</p>
<p>
    This year will be a little different compared to what we’re familiar with, and we’ll miss seeing all your faces in person. With that in mind, the organising team are extremely conscious of creating a fun, safe and educational environment where the Python community in Australia can come together online. PyConline AU won’t just be a playlist of talks—we want this to be a community event that everyone can participate in and enjoy.
</p>
<p>
    Like you, we have lots of questions in our head about what PyConline AU will be like as a virtual event. We don’t yet have all the answers! That said, here’s a few guiding points that we’re focused on.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Specialist tracks are still important—they’re a home for many parts of the Python community in Australia and beyond, and there were some fantastic proposals for specialist tracks that we’re excited to share with the world. Specialist tracks will remain a part of our virtual experience.
    </li>
    <li>
        Community is key, we want this to be a safe, inviting space for the community to connect—not just watch talks remotely. The organising team is formed from members of the community, and just as it is for many of you, the community is important to us. We’re still working out the details, but it’s high amongst our priorities.
    </li>
    <li>
        We care about having a diverse and inclusive event, and this is front and centre of the organising teams work. With more details to come with the CFP announcement, we will continue to actively support first time speakers, and welcome new members of the Python community to be a part of our online conference.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Alongside this news post, we’ll be doing an announcement stream tonight, 10 June at 7:30pm ACST (that’s UTC+0930). The video feed will be embedded shortly thereafter at the top of this announcement post.
</p>

<h2>Call for proposals (CFP)</h2>
<p>
    PyConline AU’s call for proposals will open soon (we’re aiming for within a week) and be open for until the end of June. A separate, official announcement post will announce the Specialist Tracks, the CFP details, and how to submit your proposals.  Between now and then, start thinking about what interesting topics you might like to present at PyConline AU in September.
</p>
<h2>
    Sponsorships
</h2>
<p>
    While we no longer have a hefty conference centre expense, a high quality virtual event does not run without costs. We’re still seeking sponsorships for this year’s PyConline AU event. If your employer, or someone in your network is in a position to sponsor PyConline AU we’d love to have a chat about making it a truly impactful experience. Head on over to our [sponsor page](https://2020.pycon.org.au/sponsor/) for more details.

    Hi folks.
</p>
<p>
    As you might have guessed, PyCon AU will not be held at the Adelaide Convention Centre this August. Instead, we’re going to be holding <b>PyConline AU</b> which will be, as the name suggests, an online event.
</p>
<p>
    PyCon AU is two things. It is an excellent, high quality educational event that brings Pythonistas together to teach and learn from each other, but it is also an important social event where genuine and valuable friendships are made and strengthened. The team and I are going to spend the next few months doing as much as we can to bring both of those facets to an online event. We’re still discussing ideas for exactly how, but it’s really important to us that PyConline is more than just a really long webinar.
</p>
<p>
    This is also going to be a difficult and unpredictable few months for all of us. But an online event gives us a lot more flexibility compared to an in person event. Whether you’re presenting, running a track, or on the core team, one thing we absolutely do not want is for you to feel like you’re letting the team down, simply because you need to look after yourself or those you love. So we’re going to use that flexibility to structure the event so that whatever your role, whenever you need to, you can do what you need, and the show will go on.
</p>
<p>
    I also want to thank the core team for being awesome, the PyCon AU Steering Committee and Linux Australia Council for having our backs, the Adelaide Convention Centre for being great to work with in a difficult time, and Buildkite for sponsoring PyCon AU 2020 early and sticking with us for PyConline AU.
</p>
<p>

    To end on a positive note, I want to tell you about the things that are coming up next!
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        We haven’t forgotten about specialist tracks! There were some awesome proposals, and we’re really looking forward to sharing with you the ones that we selected.
    </li>
    <li>
        We’ll hold our call for proposals soon! To find out when that happens, follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/PyConAU">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://facebook.com/PyConAU">Facebook</a>, or sign up to our mailing list:
